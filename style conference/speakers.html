						<h5>less is more:how constraints cultivate growth</h5>

They improve our consistency, which provides a better experience for our users. And they help us grow, a valuable asset in times of innovation.</p>

						<h5>what disney can teach you about user experience design</h5>
						<p>From the creation of the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, to newer animated films such as The Princess and the Frog, to the branded “Wonderful World of Disney” itself, the Disney empire has been built upon a design ecosystem. Each film, theme park, or cruise shares a holistic view of a perfect world across time and cultures. Within each experience, the same beloved character traits are highlighted, similar visual and animation styles are used, and the same story and musical techniques are leveraged to bring the audience to an emotional place. This helps make the user experience familiar and nostalgic, and lightens the audience’s cognitive load to promote enjoyment. Join Erica as she highlights Disney’s user experience techniques and outlines how you can use them to design an ecosystem that will leave behind a lasting legacy, even while waiting in an extremely long line.</p>
